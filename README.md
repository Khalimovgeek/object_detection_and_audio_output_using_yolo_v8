This project is currently in its prototype phase, with the primary aim being the identification of object motion states and providing corresponding voice feedback to the user.
The codebase draws references from documentation by Ultralytics, Stack Overflow, and ChatGPT, as well as insights from previous similar projects.
Future enhancements will include the integration of additional features such as speed detection.
The YOLO model utilized is a custom TensorFlow Lite version of YOLOv8m.
However, it's worth noting that this model's accuracy may be limited.
Therefore, I recommend considering alternative versions such as yolov8n.pt, yolov8m.pt, or a custom-trained model.
For those interested in utilizing the model, specific requirements are necessary.
These will be detailed in the accompanying requirements file.
